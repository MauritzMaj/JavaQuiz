## Description

For this assignment I built a mini-quiz about Javascript, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## Usage

- After the user clicks the "Start" button, they are automatically presented with the first out of three multiple choice questions.
- For every answer the user gives, they receive immediate feedback on whether this answer is correct or not.
- At the end of the Quiz the user can submit their name.
- The page contains a "Show Score Report" button. When clicking this the user is presented with their previous score reports.
